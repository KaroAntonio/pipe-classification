for Break records
if breaks record break rate > 5, it was replaced, else repaired
if not in break record assume pipe was fine
if age of the pipe < 40/50 yrs old it's probably in good shape, considered 'new'
	* the oldest pipes are 36 years old

W/O date is repair date	
num recent breaks, is repair in last 5 years, (before 2010)
remaaining service life is based on formula from condition model
mi = remaining servi

hydr capacity: 
env sensitive: count of close landmarks in trans data
accessibility: esa (easement col), calc, if there are any crossings, then easement is 1, else 0
conformance: calc from chart
water quality: chart

create written explanation of components
1. Model Representation
2. Bounds Implementation
3. Bounds Combination
4. Training 

add output of condition model as col in csv
