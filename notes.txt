for Break records
if breaks record break rate > 5, it was replaced, else repaired
if not in break record assume pipe was fine
if age of the pipe < 40/50 yrs old it's probably in good shape, considered 'new'
	* the oldest pipes are 36 years old

W/O date is repair date	
num recent breaks, is repair in last 5 years, (before 2010)
remaaining service life is based on formula from condition model
mi = remaining servi
pipe type: in transmission
hydr capacity: 
env sensitive: count of close landmarks in trans data
accessibility: esa (easement col), calc, if there are any crossings, then easement is 1, else 0
conformance: calc from chart
water quality: chart

----------------------------------------------------------------
Condition Score
RSL: remaining service life score
MI: maintenance index
* generate total number of breaks
* generate recent number of breaks < total num breaks
BRKS_FVYRS_SCR

PCSDesc: Expert Opinion
AR: Expert Opinion

Score = SUM () * 8

----------------------------------------------------------------
Criticality Score
CRITICAL_SCR: expert opinion
(DIAMETER SCR+ ENVMT SCR+ ACCESS SCR)*6

----------------------------------------------------------------
Performance Score
QUALITY_SCR
STANDARD_CONFOR
HEAD_LOSS_SCR: hydraulic capacity

^^^ Those three summed and mult by 10	
----------------------------------------------------------------
^^^ compare w other (weka/scipy) models

SEVERITY: expert opinion

** We are trying to do better than expert opinion

Input variables:
DIAMETER, LAND_USE,

FINAL MODEL OUTPUT
TOTAL PAN Score - High Score correlates to High Mitigation Class
Mitigation - 1:Do Nothing, 2:Repair, 3:Replace, 4: Upsize

Criticality Model : investigate the use of other models here

FOR MODEL OUTPUT 
scale model output to be in same range as the expert opinion
have a column for calculated score for each model
add normalized column for each of  the  above
try implement model to predict

TODO :: dec 16
	convert NaiveBayes to 2.7
	refactor functions into reasonable modules
